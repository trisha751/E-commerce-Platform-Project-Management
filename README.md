## Project Introduction
Nearshop (Client) wants to develope a mobile application based on an already built web application, which should be in French, Dutch and English languages.
The application should allow to :
- manage the inventory by adding or editing goods
- determine the level of accessibility for people with limited mobility (PRM)
- schedule and administer the program of activities
- manage the blog

The application should provide the possibility to edit :
- shop’s description, address, and contacts
- working hours schedule
- industry and categories of goods
- accessibility data

The major challenge lied in the implementation of the synchronization feature when a shop administrator needs to commit changes made on the mobile application to the Nearshop backend. The stability of operation is secured even in poor mobile Internet conditions such as weak signal/connection or unexpected data loss.
